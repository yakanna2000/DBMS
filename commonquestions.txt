1.What is the difference between monolithic and microservices architecture?
ChatGPT said:

Great question 👍 This is very important in software architecture interviews. Let’s break it down in a very clear and understandable way.

🔹 Monolithic Architecture

The entire application is built as one large unit.

All features (UI, business logic, database handling) are tightly coupled and run together.

If you want to update one part, you need to redeploy the whole application.

👉 Example: Imagine a shopping website (Amazon-like) built as one single program.

Product listing, cart, payment, user login, all are inside the same big codebase.

If the payment module crashes, the whole site may go down.

✅ Advantages

Simple to develop initially.

Easy to test and deploy (just one package).

Good for small applications.

❌ Disadvantages

Hard to scale – you can’t scale only one part (e.g., payment).

Deployment risk – small changes require redeploying everything.

Maintenance becomes difficult as the app grows (too much dependency).

🔹 Microservices Architecture

The application is divided into small independent services, each responsible for one function.

Services communicate using APIs (usually HTTP/REST, gRPC, or messaging queues).

Each microservice can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

👉 Example: In the same shopping website:

User Service handles login/registration.

Product Service manages product listings.

Cart Service manages items in the cart.

Payment Service handles transactions.

If the payment service crashes, only payments are affected — users can still browse products.

✅ Advantages

Independent deployment → No need to redeploy entire app.

Easier to scale → Scale only the service that has high load.

Technology flexibility → Each service can use different tech (Java for payment, Node.js for user service).

Fault isolation → One failure doesn’t crash the whole app.

❌ Disadvantages

More complex to build and manage (needs DevOps, containers, monitoring).

Network latency (services talk over the network).

Data consistency challenges (since each service may have its own DB).

2.How do you handle authentication and authorization in a full-stack app?


Great question 🚀 — this is a core topic in full-stack development interviews. Let’s go step by step in an understandable way.

🔹 Authentication vs Authorization

Authentication = Who are you? → Verifies user identity (e.g., login with email & password).

Authorization = What can you do? → Decides what resources a user can access (e.g., admin vs normal user).

🔹 How it Works in a Full-Stack App
1. Frontend (React, Angular, etc.)

User enters login details (email, password, or via Google login).

Frontend sends these details to backend API using HTTPS.

After successful login, backend sends back a token (JWT) or session ID.

The frontend stores this securely (usually in HTTP-only cookies or localStorage).

2. Backend (Node.js/Express, Django, etc.)

Backend checks login details against the database (MongoDB/MySQL).

If valid:

Backend creates a JWT (JSON Web Token) containing user info (like userId, role).

Sends this token back to the frontend.

For every new request (e.g., fetching user profile, posting data), the frontend attaches the token in the Authorization header (Bearer <token>).

Backend verifies the token before allowing access.

3. Database (MongoDB, MySQL, etc.)

Stores user credentials (emails, hashed passwords, roles).

Backend queries the DB to check if user exists and has the required role/permissions.

🔹 Flow of Authentication & Authorization

Login Request

User → enters email & password → frontend → backend → DB.

Token Generation

If valid → Backend creates a JWT → sends it to frontend.

Accessing Protected Routes

Frontend sends request → attaches token.

Backend checks token → verifies role (authorization).

If allowed → backend fetches data from DB → sends response.

🔹 Example (JWT-based)

✅ Login Response (from backend to frontend)

{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "user": {
    "id": 101,
    "name": "Yakanna",
    "role": "admin"
  }
}


✅ Frontend makes a request with token

GET /api/users
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>


✅ Backend verifies

Decodes JWT

Checks if role = admin

If yes → fetch users from DB and send back response

🔹 Common Authentication Methods

JWT (JSON Web Token) → Most common in modern apps.

Sessions + Cookies → Traditional approach (used in PHP, Django).

OAuth2 / Social Logins → Login with Google, Facebook, GitHub.

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) → OTP, Email verification, Authenticator apps.


🔹 Interview Tip

If asked, explain like this:

👉 "In a full-stack app, I use JWT-based authentication. When a user logs in, backend verifies credentials, generates a JWT, and sends it to frontend. The frontend attaches this token in every request header. Backend validates the token and checks user role for authorization before giving access. This ensures only authenticated users can access protected routes, and only authorized users can perform certain actions (like admin deleting users)."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.Explain how JWT works in authentication.


Perfect 👌 — JWT (JSON Web Token) is one of the most popular methods for authentication in modern web apps. Let’s go step by step in a very understandable way.

🔹 What is JWT?

JWT = JSON Web Token

It’s a secure token (a string of characters) that proves who you are after you log in.

Instead of sending your username & password on every request, you send a token.

🔹 Structure of JWT

A JWT has 3 parts, separated by dots:

header.payload.signature


Example:

eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiOjEsInJvbGUiOiJhZG1pbiJ9.Zw5sQkqkgfD9mC_HCkMEcFwcX4L0

1. Header → Metadata
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}

2. Payload → Actual Data (claims)
{
  "userId": 1,
  "role": "admin",
  "exp": 1725336000
}

3. Signature → Security check

Created by hashing header + payload + secret key.

Ensures the token hasn’t been changed.

🔹 How JWT Works in Authentication
1. User Logs In

User enters username & password.

Backend checks DB → if correct, backend creates a JWT with user info.

2. Backend Sends JWT

Backend responds with a JWT to the frontend.

Example response:

{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
}

3. Frontend Stores JWT

Frontend stores the token (in localStorage or HTTP-only cookie).

This token is used for all future requests.

4. Accessing Protected Routes

When frontend calls an API, it attaches the token:

GET /api/profile
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>

5. Backend Verifies Token

Backend checks the token’s signature & expiration using the secret key.

If valid → backend allows request.

If invalid/expired → backend rejects with 401 Unauthorized.

6. Response Sent Back

Backend fetches data from DB and sends it.

Example:

{
  "userId": 1,
  "name": "Yakanna",
  "role": "admin"
}

🔹 Benefits of JWT

✅ Stateless → No need to store session info in backend.
✅ Lightweight → Just a string, easy to pass in headers.
✅ Cross-platform → Works with web, mobile, APIs.

🔹 Interview-Ready Answer

👉 "JWT is a token-based authentication mechanism. After a user logs in, the backend generates a JWT containing user details and a signature. This token is sent to the client, which stores it and includes it in the Authorization header of each request. The backend verifies the token’s signature and expiration before granting access. This way, authentication is secure and stateless."

3.How does CORS work and why do we need it?

🌍 What is CORS?

CORS = Cross-Origin Resource Sharing

Imagine you are at a school.

Your teacher (browser) only allows you to borrow books (data) from your own classroom (same origin).

If you try to borrow from another classroom (different origin), the teacher says:
❌ “You are not allowed!”

👉 But if the other classroom’s teacher (server) writes a permission note saying:
✅ “Yes, this student can take books,”
then you are allowed.

That “permission note” is what CORS does using special HTTP headers.

🔹 What is CORS?

By default, browsers block requests from one domain (origin) to another for security reasons.

Example:

Your frontend runs at http://localhost:3000

Your backend API runs at http://localhost:5000

If frontend tries to fetch data from backend, the browser says: ❌ Blocked by CORS policy

👉 CORS is the protocol (set of rules) that allows the backend to say:
"Yes, I trust this other origin, it can access my resources."


🔹 How CORS Works (Step by Step)

Frontend makes a request

Example: React app running at http://localhost:3000

Wants data from backend at http://localhost:5000

fetch("http://localhost:5000/api/users")


Browser checks security

Browser sees the request is cross-origin (3000 → 5000).

It asks backend: “Hey, do you allow 3000 to access your data?”

Backend responds

If backend sends header:

Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:3000


→ Browser says ✅ “Okay, safe. Allow it.”

If backend doesn’t send → Browser blocks ❌

Preflight (for risky requests like POST/PUT/DELETE)

Browser first sends a small test request (OPTIONS) to ask:
“Can I use POST or send Authorization headers?”

Backend replies:

Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization


Then browser allows the real request.

🔹 Why Do We Need CORS?

🛡️ Security → Stops hackers from stealing your API data using other websites.

🎯 Control → You decide which websites (origins) can use your API.

🔧 Flexibility → You can allow only specific methods (GET, POST, etc.)


🔹 Interview-Ready Answer

👉 "CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a browser security feature that prevents unauthorized requests between different origins. If a frontend at one origin wants to call a backend at another origin, the backend must explicitly allow it by sending special headers like Access-Control-Allow-Origin. Without these headers, the browser blocks the response. This ensures controlled and secure cross-origin communication."

4.Explain the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture with an example.


Perfect 👍 Let’s break down MVC (Model-View-Controller) in a very simple and understandable way.

🔹 What is MVC?

MVC is a software design pattern that separates an application into 3 parts:

Model → Handles the data & logic

View → Handles the UI (what the user sees)

Controller → Acts as a middleman between Model and View

👉 This separation makes apps organized, reusable, and easy to maintain.

🔹 Real-Life Analogy

Imagine a restaurant:

Model (Kitchen) → Prepares the food (data).

View (Dining Table/Waiter) → Shows the food to customers (UI).

Controller (Waiter taking orders) → Takes customer requests and tells the kitchen what to do, then brings food back to the table.

🔹 Flow of MVC

User interacts with the View (clicks a button, fills a form).

The Controller receives the request and decides what to do.

The Model handles the data (fetch from DB, update records, apply logic).

The Controller sends the data back to the View.

The View displays the updated result to the user.

🔹 Example: User Login (Web App)
1. Model (user.js)

Handles data & logic (database operations).

// user.js (Model)
const users = [
  { id: 1, username: "yakanna", password: "1234" },
  { id: 2, username: "ram", password: "abcd" }
];

function findUser(username, password) {
  return users.find(u => u.username === username && u.password === password);
}

module.exports = { findUser };

2. Controller (authController.js)

Handles requests & responses.

// authController.js (Controller)
const { findUser } = require("./user");

function login(req, res) {
  const { username, password } = req.body;
  const user = findUser(username, password);

  if (user) {
    res.send(`Welcome, ${user.username}!`);
  } else {
    res.status(401).send("Invalid username or password");
  }
}

module.exports = { login };

3. View (login.html)

Handles UI for the user.

<!-- login.html (View) -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Login Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Login</h1>
  <form action="/login" method="POST">
    <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Enter username" />
    <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Enter password" />
    <button type="submit">Login</button>
  </form>
</body>
</html>

🔹 How It Works

User enters username & password in the View (login.html).

Form sends data to /login.

Controller (authController.js) receives the request.

Controller asks the Model (user.js) to check if the user exists.

Model returns the result.

Controller sends back the response → View displays it.

✅ Interview-Ready Answer

"MVC is an architecture that separates concerns in an application. The Model handles data and business logic, the View is responsible for the UI, and the Controller manages communication between them. For example, in a login system: the View is the login page, the Controller receives the login request, and the Model checks the user credentials in the database. This makes applications cleaner, modular, and easier to maintain."

5.What is REST API vs GraphQL? Which one would you use and why?


Great one 🙌 — this is asked a lot in Full-Stack interviews. Let’s break it down in a way that’s easy to understand and also shows you know when to use REST vs GraphQL.

🔹 REST API vs GraphQL
1. REST API (Representational State Transfer)

REST is an architectural style for building APIs.

Communication is done over HTTP methods:

GET → Read data

POST → Create data

PUT/PATCH → Update data

DELETE → Remove data

👉 In REST, each endpoint (URL) represents a resource.

Example REST endpoint:

GET /api/users/1


Response:

{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Yakanna",
  "email": "yakanna@example.com",
  "age": 22
}


✅ Advantages of REST

Simple and widely used.

Works great for CRUD operations.

Easy to implement with any backend.

⚠️ Problems with REST

Over-fetching: Sometimes you get more data than needed.
Example: You only want the user’s name, but REST returns id, email, age, etc.

Under-fetching: Sometimes you don’t get enough data and need to call multiple endpoints.
Example: /users/1 gives user data, but you need their posts too → another call to /users/1/posts.

2. GraphQL

GraphQL is a query language for APIs developed by Facebook.

Instead of multiple endpoints, you have one endpoint (/graphql).

The client asks exactly what it wants.

Example GraphQL Query:

{
  user(id: 1) {
    name
    email
    posts {
      title
    }
  }
}


Response:

{
  "user": {
    "name": "Yakanna",
    "email": "yakanna@example.com",
    "posts": [
      { "title": "My first blog" },
      { "title": "Learning GraphQL" }
    ]
  }
}


✅ Advantages of GraphQL

No over-fetching or under-fetching → Client chooses fields.

Single endpoint → Cleaner and faster.

Great for mobile apps where bandwidth matters.

Strongly typed schema → Easy to validate.

⚠️ Problems with GraphQL

More complex to set up.

Caching is harder compared to REST.

Can lead to performance issues if queries get too deep (nested data).

🔹 REST vs GraphQL Comparison
Feature	REST API	GraphQL
Endpoints	Multiple (/users, /posts)	Single (/graphql)
Data Fetching	Fixed response	Flexible → client chooses fields
Over-fetching	Common	Avoided
Under-fetching	Common (needs multiple calls)	Avoided (nested queries possible)
Learning Curve	Easy	Harder (schema + resolvers)
Best for	Simple CRUD apps, standard APIs	Complex apps, mobile apps, social feeds
🔹 Which One Would You Use and Why?

👉 Use REST when:

Project is simple (CRUD operations).

Standard APIs (e.g., Payment API, Auth API).

You need caching via HTTP easily.

Team is small and you want fast development.

👉 Use GraphQL when:

Project requires flexible and optimized data fetching (social media apps, dashboards).

You want to reduce network requests (good for mobile apps).

You need multiple resources in one query.

✅ Interview-Ready Answer

"REST is an API style where each resource has its own endpoint, and we use HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE. It’s simple and widely used but can cause over-fetching and under-fetching of data. GraphQL, on the other hand, uses a single endpoint where the client specifies exactly what data it needs, which avoids over-fetching and under-fetching. I would use REST for simple CRUD-based applications and GraphQL when the project needs flexible queries, optimized responses, or deals with complex relationships like social media feeds or dashboards."


🎯 Imagine You’re in a Restaurant

You (the client) are hungry and want food (data). The kitchen is the server (backend).

🍽️ REST API

In REST, there is a fixed menu.

If you want a burger, you go to /burger.

If you want pizza, you go to /pizza.

If you want burger + fries, you must order twice (two requests).

👉 Problem: Sometimes you get too much food (over-fetching) or you have to place too many orders (under-fetching).

Example in tech:

GET /users/1


Response gives:

{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Yakanna",
  "email": "yakanna@example.com",
  "age": 22
}


But maybe you only needed the name! That’s over-fetching.

🍽️ GraphQL

In GraphQL, there is a custom menu.

You tell the waiter exactly what you want → "Give me only burger + fries, no drink."

The kitchen gives you exactly that in one order.

Example in tech:

{
  user(id: 1) {
    name
  }
}


Response:

{
  "user": {
    "name": "Yakanna"
  }
}


👉 No extra info, no multiple orders. Just exactly what you asked for.
