✅ OOPS (Object-Oriented Programming System)
1. Definition

OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which contain data (fields/attributes) and methods (functions/behaviors).
It helps in building modular, reusable, and maintainable code.

In Java → Everything is an object.

✅ Four Main Types / Pillars of OOP
🔹 1. Encapsulation (Data Hiding)

   *  Wrapping data (variables) and code (methods) together into a single unit (class).
    
   *  Access is controlled using access modifiers (private, public, protected).
    
    * Prevents unauthorized access.

👉 Real-Time Example:

         * In a banking application, your account balance is not directly accessible.
        
       *  You can only access it using deposit/withdraw methods.
        
        * This protects the balance from unauthorized modification.

Example (Encapsulation with Getter/Setter):

class BankAccount {
    private double balance;  // private → hidden data

    // public getter and setter
    public void setBalance(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) balance = amount;
    }

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BankAccount acc = new BankAccount();
        acc.setBalance(5000);   // secure update
        System.out.println("Balance: " + acc.getBalance());
    }
}


👉 Balance is hidden and accessed only via methods.

🔹 2. Inheritance (Code Reusability)

      * Mechanism where one class (child/subclass) inherits properties & methods from another class (parent/superclass).
      
    *   Promotes reusability and avoids duplicate code.
      
     *  Achieved using extends keyword in Java.

👉 Real-Time Example:

 * In a Ride-Sharing App (Uber/Ola),

       * Vehicle is a parent class.

        * Car, Bike, Auto inherit properties like start(), stop(), fuelType().


Types of Inheritance in Java:

    * Single (one parent → one child)

   * Multilevel (grandparent → parent → child)

   * Hierarchical (one parent → many children)

  * ❌ Multiple inheritance (not supported with classes, only via interfaces).

Example:

class Vehicle {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle is starting...");
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    void honk() {
        System.out.println("Car is honking...");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car = new Car();
        car.start();  // inherited from Vehicle
        car.honk();
    }
}


🔹 3. Polymorphism (Many Forms)

One action behaves differently in different situations.

Two types:

1.Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)

   * Same method name, different parameter list.

2.Runtime Polymorphism (Method Overriding)

    * Subclass provides a specific implementation of a method defined in superclass.


👉 Real-Time Example:

* In an E-commerce Payment System (Amazon, Flipkart),

          * Payment can be done via CreditCard, UPI, NetBanking, Wallet.
          
         *  The method is the same → pay(), but implementation differs.

Example (Overloading + Overriding):

class Calculator {
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
    double add(double a, double b) { // Overloading
        return a + b;
    }
}

class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes sound");
    }
}
class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() { // Overriding
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calculator c = new Calculator();
        System.out.println(c.add(2, 3));       // calls int version
        System.out.println(c.add(2.5, 3.5));   // calls double version

        Animal a = new Dog();
        a.sound();   // Runtime → "Dog barks"
    }
}



🔹 4. Abstraction (Hiding Implementation Details)

* Hides internal implementation and shows only essential features.

* Achieved using:

    * Abstract classes (using abstract keyword).

  * Interfaces (pure abstraction, from Java 8 → default & static methods).

👉 Real-Time Example:

 * In an ATM Machine,

        * You press buttons like Withdraw, Deposit, Balance Inquiry.
        
       *  You don’t know how internally ATM communicates with the bank servers.
        
        * You just see the functionality (interface), not the implementation.

Example:

abstract class Shape {
    abstract void draw();  // abstract method (no body)
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing Circle");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape s = new Circle();
        s.draw();   // abstraction → only know "draw()", not internal logic
    }
}
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 4 core features of Java that stand out are:

1.Object-Oriented

2.Platform Independent (WORA)

3.Robust & Secure

4.Multithreaded

Let’s go one by one 👇

✅ 1. Object-Oriented
Meaning:

        Java is based on the concept of Objects and Classes.
        
        Real-world entities (like Car, Employee, BankAccount) are modeled as objects.
        
        OOP principles (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction) make the system modular, reusable, and maintainable.

Real-Time Example:

 In a Banking System,

        Customer → object with data like name, balance.
        
        Account → object with deposit/withdraw methods.

 These map directly into Java classes.

Code Example:
class Employee {
    String name;
    int salary;

    void work() {
        System.out.println(name + " is working");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Employee emp = new Employee();
        emp.name = "John";
        emp.salary = 50000;
        emp.work();
    }
}


👉 This shows how real-life entities are represented as objects.

✅ 2. Platform Independent (Write Once, Run Anywhere)
Meaning:

        In Java, code is compiled into bytecode (.class file) by the Java compiler.
        
        This bytecode runs on the JVM (Java Virtual Machine), not directly on the OS.
        
        So the same Java program can run on Windows, Linux, Mac, Android — without rewriting.

👉 Famous slogan: “Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)”.

Real-Time Example:
        
        If a company builds an ERP system in Java, they don’t have to rewrite it separately for Windows, Linux, and macOS.
        
        They just ship the .class files, and JVM takes care of execution on different systems.

Diagram (simplified):
Java Code (.java) → javac → Bytecode (.class) → JVM → OS → Hardware

Code Example:
# Compile
javac Hello.java   # produces Hello.class (bytecode)

# Run (any OS with JVM installed)
java Hello


👉 This cross-platform support is one of the biggest reasons Java is so widely used.

✅ 3. Robust & Secure
Meaning:

Robust (Strong): Java is designed to reduce runtime errors.

        Automatic Garbage Collection → no memory leaks.
        
        Exception Handling → catches errors gracefully.
        
        No explicit pointers → prevents unsafe memory access.

Secure: Java programs run inside the JVM sandbox.

        Bytecode is verified before execution.
        
        Security Manager controls access to system resources.
        
        No pointer manipulation → prevents hacking/unauthorized memory access.

Real-Time Example:

        In Banking Applications (like SBI, HDFC net banking), security is critical.
        
        Java’s built-in security (no pointer misuse) and error handling make it safer compared to C/C++.

Code Example (Robustness via Exception Handling):

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            int x = 10 / 0;  // risky code
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Error handled: " + e.getMessage());
        }
        System.out.println("Program continues...");
    }
}


👉 Without handling, the program would crash. With exception handling, it runs smoothly.

✅ 4. Multithreaded
Meaning:

          Java supports multithreading, i.e., running multiple tasks in parallel within a single program.
          
          Each thread runs independently but shares common resources.
          
          This makes applications faster and efficient.

Real-Time Example:

  In a video streaming app (like YouTube):

            One thread → plays video.
            
            Another thread → downloads data.
            
            Another thread → listens for user input (pause/play).

👉 All tasks run simultaneously, thanks to multithreading.

Code Example:
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread running: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
        MyThread t2 = new MyThread();
        
        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}


👉 Output shows both threads running concurrently.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
JAVA
1.What is loose coupling and strong coupling?

✅ Interview-Style Answer
1. Definition

Coupling in Java means the degree of dependency between two classes or modules.

It answers: “How much does Class A know about Class B?”

👉 Two types:

Tight (Strong) Coupling → High dependency.

Loose Coupling → Low dependency.

2. Strong (Tight) Coupling

          One class is highly dependent on another class’s implementation.
          
          If one class changes, the other class must change too.
          
          This makes the system hard to maintain, extend, or test.
Real-World Analogy: 

A smartphone with a soldered, non-removable battery. If the battery dies, you can't just swap it out; you have to take the whole phone apart (modify the existing system) to replace it. The phone and battery are tightly coupled.

Example (Tight Coupling without interfaces):

class PetrolEngine {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Petrol Engine Starting...");
    }
}

class Car {
    PetrolEngine engine;  // directly depends on PetrolEngine

    Car() {
        engine = new PetrolEngine(); // strong coupling
    }

    void startCar() {
        engine.start();
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car = new Car();
        car.startCar();  // Works only with PetrolEngine
    }
}


❌ Problem → If tomorrow we want a DieselEngine, we must modify the Car class. This shows tight coupling.

3. Loose Coupling

      One class depends only on abstraction (interface/abstract class), not a concrete implementation.
      
      We can change implementations without modifying the dependent class.
      
      This makes the system flexible, reusable, testable, and maintainable.

Real-World Analogy:

A standardized power socket. Your lamp (the Car) is designed to work with any device that plugs into the socket and provides electricity (the Engine interface). You can plug in a halogen bulb (PowerfulEngine), an LED bulb (ElectricEngine), or even a night light (TestEngine) without rewiring the lamp itself. The socket defines the contract (voltage, plug shape).

Example (Loose Coupling using Interface):

// Abstraction
interface Engine {
    void start();
}

// Implementations
class PetrolEngine implements Engine {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Petrol Engine Starting...");
    }
}

class DieselEngine implements Engine {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Diesel Engine Starting...");
    }
}

// Car depends only on abstraction
class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    // Dependency Injection
    Car(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }

    void startCar() {
        engine.start();
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Engine petrol = new PetrolEngine();
        Car car1 = new Car(petrol);
        car1.startCar();

        Engine diesel = new DieselEngine();
        Car car2 = new Car(diesel);
        car2.startCar();
    }
}


✅ Advantage → Car doesn’t care if it’s PetrolEngine, DieselEngine, or ElectricEngine.
We can add new engines without modifying Car → Loose Coupling.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 2. Data Structure mainly Trees concept

1. What is a Tree?
A Tree is a non-linear data structure that simulates a hierarchical tree structure. It's a collection of entities called nodes connected by edges. Each node contains a value and references to its children.

Why is it non-linear? Unlike arrays or linked lists which have a strict linear sequence, trees branch out, allowing for faster access and insertion/deletion than linear structures.

2. Key Terminology
Root: The topmost node in a tree (Node A in the diagram below).

Parent/Child: A node connected to another node when moving away from the Root. (A is the parent of B and C. B and C are children of A).

Siblings: Nodes with the same parent (B and C are siblings).

Leaf (External) Node: A node with no children (D, E, F).

Internal Node: A node with at least one child (A, B, C).

Edge: The link connecting two nodes.

Path: A sequence of nodes and edges connecting a node with a descendant.

Depth: The number of edges from the root to the node. (Depth of A is 0, depth of B is 1).

Height: The number of edges on the longest path from the node to a leaf. (Height of the tree is the height of the root. Height of B is 1, height of A is 2).

Subtree: A tree consisting of a node and all of its descendants.

Visual Representation:

text
        A  (Root, Depth=0, Height=2)
       / \
      B   C (Siblings, Depth=1)
     / \   \
    D   E   F (Leaves, Depth=2)
    (Height=0)
3. Why are Trees Important? (Real-Time Examples)
File Systems: The directories and folders on your computer form a tree structure. The root directory (C:\ or /) has sub-directories (Program Files, Users), which themselves have more sub-directories.

Domain Name System (DNS): The organization of domain names (com, org, google, www) is a tree, allowing for efficient routing of internet traffic.

Organization Hierarchy: The CEO at the root, followed by VPs, managers, and employees. This is a classic tree.

JARUS-specific Example - Decision Making for Drones:
An autonomous drone uses a tree structure called a Behavior Tree to make decisions.

The root node might be "Complete Delivery".

Its children could be "Navigate to Destination" and "Handle Obstacle".

"Navigate to Destination" might have children like "Calculate Path", "Maintain Altitude", and "Check Battery".

This allows the drone to traverse the tree, making complex decisions based on environmental inputs (e.g., if an obstacle is detected, it moves to the "Handle Obstacle" branch).

4. Common Types of Trees (From Most to Least Important for Interviews)
a) Binary Tree
A tree where each node has at most two children, typically referred to as the left child and right child.

java
class TreeNode {
    int value;
    TreeNode left;  // Reference to left child
    TreeNode right; // Reference to right child

    TreeNode(int value) {
        this.value = value;
        this.right = null;
        this.left = null;
    }
}
b) Binary Search Tree (BST)
A Binary Tree with a special ordering property:

For any node, all values in its left subtree are less than the node's value.

All values in its right subtree are greater than the node's value.

This property enables very efficient searching, insertion, and deletion (Average Time: O(log n)).

Example:

text
        10
       /  \
      5    15
     / \     \
    3   7     20
Searching for 7: Start at 10 -> go left to 5 -> go right to 7 (Found!).

c) Balanced vs. Unbalanced Trees
Balanced (e.g., AVL, Red-Black Trees): A tree where the height of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by at most 1. This ensures operations remain O(log n).

Unbalanced: A tree that can degenerate into a linked list in the worst case, making operations O(n).

text
// An unbalanced BST (worst-case scenario - just a linked list)
1
 \
  2
   \
    3
     \
      4
d) Other Important Types
Trie (Prefix Tree): Specialized for storing strings. Used for autocomplete features and IP routing. Each node represents a character.

Heap: A complete binary tree where each node is greater (max-heap) or smaller (min-heap) than its children. Used for efficient priority queues and sorting (Heapsort).

B-Tree / B+ Tree: Trees with more than two children per node. Crucial for database indexing and file systems because they minimize disk I/O.

5. Tree Traversals (VISITING EVERY NODE)
This is a very common interview question. The four main ways to traverse a binary tree:

1. Inorder (Left, Root, Right)

Result: Visits nodes in ascending order in a BST.

Code:

java
void inorderTraversal(TreeNode node) {
    if (node == null) return;
    inorderTraversal(node.left);   // 1. Traverse left subtree
    System.out.print(node.value + " "); // 2. Visit the root
    inorderTraversal(node.right);  // 3. Traverse right subtree
}
// Output for the BST example: 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20
2. Preorder (Root, Left, Right)

Use Case: Good for creating a copy of the tree.

Code:

java
void preorderTraversal(TreeNode node) {
    if (node == null) return;
    System.out.print(node.value + " "); // 1. Visit the root
    preorderTraversal(node.left);   // 2. Traverse left subtree
    preorderTraversal(node.right);  // 3. Traverse right subtree
}
// Output: 10, 5, 3, 7, 15, 20
3. Postorder (Left, Right, Root)

Use Case: Good for deleting the tree (you delete children before the parent).

Code:

java
void postorderTraversal(TreeNode node) {
    if (node == null) return;
    postorderTraversal(node.left);  // 1. Traverse left subtree
    postorderTraversal(node.right); // 2. Traverse right subtree
    System.out.print(node.value + " "); // 3. Visit the root
}
// Output: 3, 7, 5, 20, 15, 10
4. Level Order (Breadth-First Search - BFS)

How: Uses a queue. Visit nodes level by level.

Code:

java
void levelOrderTraversal(TreeNode root) {
    if (root == null) return;
    Queue<TreeNode> queue = new LinkedList<>();
    queue.add(root);

    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        TreeNode currentNode = queue.poll();
        System.out.print(currentNode.value + " ");

        if (currentNode.left != null) queue.add(currentNode.left);
        if (currentNode.right != null) queue.add(currentNode.right);
    }
}
// Output: 10, 5, 15, 3, 7, 20
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 3. What is input and output buffering?

🔹 What is Buffering?

A buffer is just a temporary memory (like a box) that stores data while it is being transferred between two places (like between a program and a file, or program and network).

The idea is: instead of sending/receiving data one small piece at a time (which is slow), we collect data in the buffer and then send/receive in bulk (faster).

🔹 Input Buffering

Definition: Input buffering means when we read data (like from a file, keyboard, or network), it is first stored in a buffer in memory. The program then reads from that buffer instead of directly from the device.

Why? Because reading data directly from devices (like disk or keyboard) is slow compared to memory operations.

So buffering reduces the number of device accesses and speeds up input.

✅ Example 1 (Keyboard input):
When you type on the keyboard, the characters don’t directly go to your program.
They are first collected in a buffer (usually until you press Enter). Then the program reads the whole line from the buffer.

✅ Example 2 (File Input in Java):

import java.io.*;

public class InputBufferExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader("data.txt");
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr); // Input buffering

        String line;
        while((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
            System.out.println(line);
        }
        br.close();
    }
}


Here, instead of reading the file character by character (slow),
BufferedReader reads a big chunk of data at once into memory and gives it line by line → Faster.

🔹 Output Buffering

Definition: Output buffering means when we write data (to file, screen, or network), it is not written immediately. Instead, it is stored in a buffer and written all at once when the buffer is full or explicitly flushed.

Why? Because writing data to devices (disk, printer, network) is slow. Buffering makes it efficient.

✅ Example 1 (System.out.print in Java):
When you use System.out.print("Hello"), sometimes it does not appear instantly on the console until you call System.out.flush() or print a newline (println). That’s because of output buffering.

✅ Example 2 (File Output in Java):

import java.io.*;

public class OutputBufferExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        FileWriter fw = new FileWriter("output.txt");
        BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(fw); // Output buffering

        bw.write("Hello, this is written using buffering!");
        bw.newLine();
        bw.write("Data is stored in buffer first.");
        
        bw.flush(); // flush buffer to file
        bw.close();
    }
}


Here, data is first written to the buffer.
Only when we call flush() or close(), the buffer contents go to the file.

🔹 Real-Life Analogy (Easy to Remember in Interview)

Imagine writing letters and sending them by courier:

Without buffering → You send each letter one by one (slow, costly).

With buffering → You collect all letters in an envelope (buffer) and send them together (fast, efficient).

Similarly:

Input buffering = Receiving courier packages in bulk, then reading inside one by one.

Output buffering = Collecting letters in an envelope before sending out.

✅ Interview Point:

Input/Output buffering is mainly used to improve performance by minimizing the number of slow I/O operations.

In Java, classes like BufferedReader, BufferedWriter, BufferedInputStream, and BufferedOutputStream use buffering.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 4. Java collections and why hashing is not included in collections?

Java Collections Framework

Definition:
Java Collections Framework (JCF) is a set of interfaces and classes that provide ready-made data structures (like List, Set, Queue, Map) and algorithms (like sorting, searching).

Goal: To make data storage, retrieval, and manipulation easier with reusable, consistent APIs.

👉 Main interfaces in Collections:

List – Ordered collection, allows duplicates (e.g., ArrayList, LinkedList).

Set – Unique elements, no duplicates (e.g., HashSet, TreeSet).

Queue – Follows FIFO, supports priority (e.g., PriorityQueue, LinkedList).

Map – Key-value pairs (e.g., HashMap, TreeMap).

Why Hashing is NOT directly part of Collections?

This is a tricky part—interviewers ask to see if you know the design perspective of Java.

🔹 1. Collections Framework is about "Collection of Objects"

Collection interface (root of the hierarchy) represents a group of individual objects (like a bag of items).

Hashing is not a collection type, it is an algorithm/technique used for fast data access.

👉 Example:

ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet → all store objects.

But hashing is not a container; it’s a mechanism to organize and access data quickly.

🔹 2. Maps (like HashMap, Hashtable) do use hashing

Map is not a sub-interface of Collection (different hierarchy).

Why? Because a map stores key-value pairs, while a collection stores individual objects.

Hashing is implemented inside Map classes (like HashMap, Hashtable), but hashing itself is not exposed as a "collection".

👉 Example:

Map<String, Integer> studentMarks = new HashMap<>();
studentMarks.put("Alice", 85);
studentMarks.put("Bob", 90);

// Hashing is used internally to store/retrieve values quickly
System.out.println(studentMarks.get("Alice")); // O(1) lookup


Here, hashing is working inside HashMap, but you don’t see it directly in Collections.

🔹 3. Design Principle (Separation of Concerns)

Collections = data structures

Hashing = algorithm for storage/retrieval

If Java added "Hashing" as part of Collections, it would mix abstraction levels (data structures vs. algorithms).

That’s why Java designers kept hashing hidden inside implementation classes (HashMap, HashSet, Hashtable).

✅ Interview Answer (Crisp & Clear)

Java Collections Framework provides interfaces and classes like List, Set, Queue, and Map to store and manipulate groups of objects. Hashing, however, is not included directly because it is not a data structure by itself, but a technique used internally to achieve fast access in classes like HashMap, HashSet, and Hashtable. Also, Collection deals with individual objects, whereas Map stores key-value pairs, so Map is kept separate from the Collection hierarchy. This separation maintains clean design and abstraction.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Java Collections Framework Hierarchy

In Java, the Collections Framework is divided into two main parts:

Collection Interface (java.util.Collection) → for working with groups of objects.

Sub-interfaces: List, Set, Queue, Deque

Map Interface (java.util.Map) → for working with key-value pairs.

Not a child of Collection, but part of the framework.

   |           |           |
  List (I)    Set (I)     Queue (I)
   |           |            |
ArrayList    HashSet      PriorityQueue

Vector       LinkedHashSet
Stack

Breakdown
1. Iterable (Root Interface)

Super interface of all collection classes.

Defines the method iterator() for iteration (used in enhanced for-loop).

2. Collection Interface

Defines core methods like add(), remove(), size(), clear(), etc.

Sub-interfaces of Collection:

List (Ordered, Allows Duplicates)

Implementations: ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, Stack

Set (Unordered, No Duplicates)

Implementations: HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet

Queue (FIFO order, Can allow duplicates)

Implementations: PriorityQueue, ArrayDeque, LinkedList

3. Map Interface (Key-Value Pairs, No duplicate keys)

Implementations:

HashMap, LinkedHashMap, TreeMap, Hashtable

✅ Key Notes for Interview

Map is not a child of Collection, but it’s part of the Collections Framework.

Collection → works with elements.

Map → works with key-value pairs.

List → preserves order, allows duplicates.

Set → no duplicates.

Queue → follows FIFO/LIFO depending on implementation.

 5. What are annotations in Java?

What are Annotations in Java?

Annotations in Java are metadata (extra information) that you can add to your code.
They do not directly affect program logic, but they provide instructions to the compiler, runtime, or frameworks.

Think of annotations as labels or tags you put on your code, so that tools or libraries can understand how to treat it.

Types of Annotations in Java

Java provides three main categories:

Built-in Annotations (provided by Java)

@Override → tells the compiler a method is overriding a superclass method.

@Deprecated → marks a method/class as outdated.

@SuppressWarnings → tells compiler to ignore warnings.

Meta-Annotations (annotations for annotations)

@Retention → tells how long the annotation is retained (source, class, runtime).

@Target → defines where annotation can be applied (method, class, field).

@Inherited → allows subclasses to inherit annotations.

Custom Annotations (user-defined)

You can create your own annotation using @interface.

Examples
1. Built-in Annotation Example
class Parent {
    void display() {
        System.out.println("Parent display");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    @Override   // ensures overriding is correct
    void display() {
        System.out.println("Child display");
    }
}


✅ If you misspell display (like dispaly), the compiler throws an error because of @Override.

2. @Deprecated Example
class OldCode {
    @Deprecated
    void oldMethod() {
        System.out.println("This method is deprecated");
    }
}

class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        OldCode obj = new OldCode();
        obj.oldMethod(); // compiler shows warning
    }
}


👉 This warns developers that oldMethod() should not be used anymore.

3. Custom Annotation Example
import java.lang.annotation.*;

@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target(ElementType.METHOD)
@interface MyAnnotation {
    String author() default "Unknown";
    int version() default 1;
}

class Demo {
    @MyAnnotation(author = "Yakanna", version = 2)
    public void myMethod() {
        System.out.println("Custom Annotation Example");
    }
}


Here we created a custom annotation @MyAnnotation and applied it to a method.
Frameworks like Spring, Hibernate use custom annotations heavily (e.g., @Autowired, @Entity, @RestController).

Interview Key Points

Annotations = Metadata (information about code).

They don’t change execution but guide compiler, runtime, or frameworks.

Used in frameworks (Spring Boot, JPA, Hibernate). Example:

@Entity → tells Hibernate this class maps to a database table.

@Autowired → tells Spring to inject a dependency.

🔥 Real-World Example:

In Spring Boot, instead of writing XML configs, we just use annotations:

@RestController
public class UserController {
    @GetMapping("/users")
    public String getUsers() {
        return "List of Users";
    }
}


Here:

@RestController → tells Spring this is a REST controller.

@GetMapping("/users") → maps HTTP GET request to getUsers() method.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 6. Whyis spring boot and framework introduced in Java?

The Problem: "Why was it needed?"
Imagine building a large, complex enterprise application for banking, e-commerce, or a company like JARUS (with drones, logistics, etc.) using only core Java (Java SE). You would face several major challenges:

Tight Coupling: Business logic (e.g., OrderService) would be directly instantiated with new inside other classes (e.g., OrderController). This makes the code rigid, hard to test, and difficult to modify.

java
// WITHOUT SPRING - Tightly Coupled, Hard to Test
public class OrderController {
    // The controller is hardcoded to use this specific service
    private OrderService orderService = new OrderService();

    public void processOrder() {
        orderService.process();
    }
}
Bolierplate Code: Common tasks like transaction management, security, and logging required writing the same repetitive, verbose code in every project.

java
// Manual Transaction Management Boilerplate (Simplified)
Connection conn = null;
try {
    conn = dataSource.getConnection();
    conn.setAutoCommit(false); // Begin transaction

    // ... business logic ...

    conn.commit(); // Commit transaction
} catch (SQLException e) {
    if (conn != null) conn.rollback(); // Rollback on error
} finally {
    if (conn != null) conn.close();
}
Painful Integration: Getting different technologies (e.g., Hibernate for ORM, Tomcat as a server, Jackson for JSON) to work together required a lot of manual configuration and wiring.

Configuration Hell: Managing dependencies and their versions using build tools like Ant or early Maven was complex. Configuring applications involved massive, unwieldy XML files.

In short, developers were spending more time on "plumbing" code (wiring things together) than on writing actual business logic (solving the real problem).

The Solution Part 1: Spring Framework
The Spring Framework was introduced to address these issues by providing a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications.

Its core power comes from two principles:

Dependency Injection (DI) / Inversion of Control (IoC):
This is the heart of Spring. Instead of a class creating its own dependencies (new OrderService()), the dependencies are injected into it by the Spring IoC Container. The container is a framework that manages objects ("beans") and their life cycle.

How it solves coupling:

java
// WITH SPRING - Loosely Coupled, Easy to Test
@Controller
public class OrderController {

    // The dependency is declared but not created here
    @Autowired
    private OrderService orderService; // Spring injects this!

    public void processOrder() {
        orderService.process();
    }
}

@Service
public class OrderService {
    // Spring will automatically create one instance (a Singleton) of this service
}
Result: OrderController is no longer tied to OrderService. You can easily swap the implementation for testing (e.g., inject a MockOrderService) or for different environments.

Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP):
Spring allows you to define cross-cutting concerns—functionality that applies across many parts of the application (like logging, security, transactions)—separately from the business logic. Spring then weaves them together automatically.

How it solves boilerplate:
You can declare a transaction requirement declaratively with an annotation, and Spring handles the boilerplate code shown earlier.

java
@Service
public class BankService {

    @Transactional // <- That's it! Spring handles begin/commit/rollback.
    public void transferMoney(Account from, Account to, double amount) {
        // ... your pure business logic here ...
        withdraw(from, amount);
        deposit(to, amount);
    }
}
What Spring Framework provided: A powerful, flexible toolbox for building enterprise apps by promoting loose coupling and reducing boilerplate.

The Solution Part 2: Spring Boot
Spring Framework was powerful, but it came with a cost: Complex Configuration. You still had to spend significant time writing XML or Java configuration to set up the framework itself, choose compatible library versions, and deploy your application.

Spring Boot was introduced to make Spring itself easier to use. Its mantra is "convention over configuration."

Spring Boot's key features:

Auto-Configuration: Spring Boot automatically configures your application based on the libraries (JARs) it finds on the classpath. If it sees H2 database in the classpath, it auto-configures an in-memory datasource. If it sees Spring MVC, it auto-configures a web server (Tomcat by default). You only need to override this configuration if you want non-default behavior.

Standalone Applications: Spring Boot allows you to package your application as a single, executable JAR file that has an embedded web server (Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow). You don't need to deploy a WAR file to an external Tomcat server. You can just run java -jar myapp.jar.

Starter Dependencies: Simple Maven descriptors that bundle all the necessary dependencies for a specific functionality.

Need a web app? Add spring-boot-starter-web.

Need data access? Add spring-boot-starter-data-jpa.

Need security? Add spring-boot-starter-security.
This eliminates version conflicts and dependency hell.

Production-Ready Features: It provides built-in tools like Spring Boot Actuator for monitoring your application (health checks, metrics, info) and Spring Boot DevTools for fast developer restarts.

Real-Time Analogy
Core Java: Building a car from scratch. You have to manufacture every single screw, wire the electronics, and build the engine yourself. It's flexible but incredibly time-consuming.

Spring Framework: A kit car. You get a pre-built chassis, engine, and wiring harness (the Spring modules). You still have to assemble and connect all the parts yourself (the configuration), but you didn't have to forge the metal.

Spring Boot: A fully assembled, production-ready car. You just get in, turn the key, and drive. The "conventions" (the standard design) are already chosen for you, but you can still customize the paint and seats if you want.

Summary: Why They Were Introduced
Spring Framework	Spring Boot
Primary Goal	To solve application development complexity by enabling loose coupling and reducing boilerplate code via DI and AOP.	To solve Spring's configuration complexity and simplify deployment.
Key Concept	Dependency Injection & Aspect-Oriented Programming	Auto-Configuration & Convention Over Configuration
Analogy	A powerful toolbox with all the best tools.	A pre-assembled product built with those tools.
For an interview at JARUS: You can conclude by saying that these technologies allow developers to focus on the unique business logic of the domain (e.g., drone flight paths, logistics algorithms, sensor data processing) instead of the underlying plumbing, leading to more robust, maintainable, and faster-developed applications.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Write example for dynamic polymorphism

Dynamic Polymorphism in Java

👉 Definition:
Dynamic polymorphism (also called Runtime Polymorphism) is when a method call is resolved at runtime instead of compile time.
This happens using method overriding (not method overloading).

Method Overloading = Compile-time polymorphism.

Method Overriding = Runtime polymorphism (dynamic).

Example of Dynamic Polymorphism
// Parent class
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

// Child class
class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

// Another child class
class Cat extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Cat meows");
    }
}

public class DynamicPolymorphismExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal a;  // reference of parent class

        a = new Dog();   // object of Dog
        a.sound();       // Output: Dog barks

        a = new Cat();   // object of Cat
        a.sound();       // Output: Cat meows
    }
}

Explanation

We have a parent class (Animal) and child classes (Dog, Cat) that override the sound() method.

The parent class reference Animal a; can hold any child class object.

Which method gets executed depends on the object type at runtime, not the reference type.

👉 That’s why it is called Dynamic (Runtime) Polymorphism.

Real-Life Example

Think of a remote control (parent).

The same remote (reference) can control TV, AC, or Music System (child objects).

The button pressed (method call) will behave differently depending on which device is connected.

✅ Interview Tip:
When asked this question, always explain the difference between compile-time polymorphism (method overloading) and runtime polymorphism (method overriding), then write a method overriding example like above.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 8. Tell me about Finalize keyword

🔹 What is finalize in Java?

In Java, finalize() is a method in the Object class.
It is called by the Garbage Collector (GC) before destroying an object to allow the object to clean up resources (like closing files, releasing memory, disconnecting from networks, etc.).

👉 Think of it like a “last chance cleanup” before the object is deleted from memory.


2. How was it supposed to work?
The concept was part of Java's original design for resource management. The idea was:

When an object becomes eligible for garbage collection (i.e., no more live references point to it), the Garbage Collector is scheduled to run.

Before actually deleting the object and reclaiming its memory, the GC would call the object's finalize() method.

Inside the finalize() method, the object could release critical system resources that it was holding, such as:

File handles (FileInputStream, FileOutputStream)

Network sockets

Database connections

Native resources (memory allocated outside the JVM, e.g., through JNI)


🔹 Syntax of finalize()
protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
    // cleanup code
}


It is protected → So that subclasses can override it.

It can throw exceptions.

It is defined in java.lang.Object, so every class in Java can override it.

🔹 When is finalize() called?

When the Garbage Collector decides that an object is no longer reachable (no references exist).

Before the object’s memory is reclaimed, finalize() (if overridden) is called once.

⚠️ Important:

You cannot predict when finalize() will be called.

It may never be called if the program exits before GC runs.

🔹 Example of finalize()
class Demo {
    String name;

    Demo(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    // Override finalize method
    @Override
    protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
        System.out.println("Finalize called for: " + name);
    }
}

public class FinalizeExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Demo d1 = new Demo("Object1");
        Demo d2 = new Demo("Object2");

        d1 = null; // eligible for GC
        d2 = null; // eligible for GC

        System.gc(); // Request JVM to run Garbage Collector

        System.out.println("Main method completed.");
    }
}

✅ Output (may vary):
Main method completed.
Finalize called for: Object2
Finalize called for: Object1


(Notice: The order is not guaranteed.)

🔹 Why is finalize() discouraged?

Unpredictable: You don’t know when or if it will run.

Performance cost: It makes Garbage Collection slower.

Deprecated: Since Java 9, finalize() is marked as deprecated because better resource management techniques exist.

🔹 Best Alternative to finalize()

Instead of using finalize(), we should use:

try-with-resources (Java 7+) → Automatically closes resources like files, DB connections.

AutoCloseable interface → Custom cleanup logic.

Explicit cleanup methods → Example: close(), disconnect(), etc.

🔹 Real-life Analogy 🚗

Think of finalize() like a car scrap process:

When your car is no longer usable (object not referenced), it goes to a scrap yard (GC).

Before scrapping, you may want to remove the stereo system or personal items (cleanup in finalize()).

But you don’t know exactly when the car will be scrapped → Same unpredictability with finalize().



The Bottom Line for Your Interview
"The finalize method was an old, flawed idea for cleanup in Java. You couldn't rely on it because it might run too late or not at all. It's now deprecated. Today, we always use try-with-resources because it makes cleanup immediate and predictable."
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 9. What is the relationship between classes in java?


🔹 Relationship Between Classes in Java

In Java, classes relate to each other mainly in two broad ways:

IS-A Relationship (Inheritance)

HAS-A Relationship (Association/Composition/Aggregation)

1. IS-A Relationship (Inheritance)

This means one class is a subtype of another.

Implemented using extends (for classes) and implements (for interfaces).

It represents specialization: Child class extends Parent class to reuse and add functionality.

✅ Example:

class Vehicle {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle starting...");
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {  // IS-A relationship
    void playMusic() {
        System.out.println("Playing music...");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car c = new Car();
        c.start();       // Inherited from Vehicle
        c.playMusic();   // Defined in Car
    }
}


📌 Here, Car IS-A Vehicle. This allows code reusability and polymorphism.

2. HAS-A Relationship (Composition & Aggregation)

This means a class contains another class as a field (member variable).

Composition (Strong HAS-A):

One class owns another completely.

If the container object is destroyed → the contained object is also destroyed.

✅ Example:

class Engine {
    void run() {
        System.out.println("Engine running...");
    }
}

class Car {
    private Engine engine;   // Composition

    Car() {
        engine = new Engine();  // Car owns Engine
    }

    void startCar() {
        engine.run();  // Car uses Engine
        System.out.println("Car started!");
    }
}


📌 Here, Car HAS-A Engine. Without Car, engine object doesn’t exist → Composition.

Aggregation (Weak HAS-A):

A class contains another class, but they are independent.

If container is destroyed → the contained object can still exist.

✅ Example:

class Student {
    String name;
    Student(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}

class Department {
    private String deptName;
    private List<Student> students;   // Aggregation

    Department(String deptName, List<Student> students) {
        this.deptName = deptName;
        this.students = students;  // Dept HAS-A Student
    }
}


📌 Here, Department HAS-A Student. Even if Department is deleted, students can still exist → Aggregation.

3. Dependency Relationship (Uses-A)

When one class depends on another class temporarily (usually as a method parameter).

Not a strong relationship.

✅ Example:

class Printer {
    void print(String text) {
        System.out.println(text);
    }
}

class User {
    void usePrinter(Printer p) {   // Dependency (Uses-A)
        p.print("Printing user document...");
    }
}

🔹 Summary Table (Easy to Remember)
Relationship	Keyword / Concept	Example	Lifetime Dependency
IS-A	extends, implements	Car IS-A Vehicle	Parent & Child together
HAS-A (Composition)	Class as a field	Car HAS-A Engine	Strong, owned by parent
HAS-A (Aggregation)	Class as a field (independent)	Department HAS-A Student	Weak, independent
Uses-A (Dependency)	Method parameters	User uses Printer	Temporary

✅ Interview Tip:
If interviewer asks:
👉 "What are class relationships in Java?"
You can say:

Java supports IS-A (inheritance) and HAS-A (composition/aggregation).

Additionally, classes can have dependency relationships (uses-a).

These relationships define how objects interact and how code is reused.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10.Can private keyword be used with constructor?


❓ Can private keyword be used with a constructor in Java?

👉 Yes, we can declare a constructor as private in Java.

✅ Why do we need a private constructor?

A private constructor restricts object creation from outside the class.
It is mainly used in the following scenarios:

1️⃣ Singleton Design Pattern

Ensures that only one instance of a class can exist in the JVM.

Constructor is private, so no other class can create a new object.

The instance is created inside the class and returned through a getInstance() method.

📌 Example:

class Singleton {
    // Step 1: Create a private static instance of the class
    private static Singleton instance;

    // Step 2: Private constructor (no other class can call it)
    private Singleton() {
        System.out.println("Private Constructor Called");
    }

    // Step 3: Public method to provide global access point
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Singleton obj1 = new Singleton(); ❌ Error (constructor is private)
        Singleton obj1 = Singleton.getInstance();
        Singleton obj2 = Singleton.getInstance();

        System.out.println(obj1 == obj2); // true (same object)
    }
}


👉 Here, only one object of Singleton is created.


⚠️ Important Points for Interview:

✅ Yes, private constructors are allowed in Java.

✅ They are used to restrict instantiation.

✅ Commonly used in Singleton, Factory Methods, Utility Classes.

❌ If you declare only a private constructor and no public method to create objects → the class cannot be instantiated anywhere.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11. Can we use a package inside another package?


🔹 What is a Package?

A package is a way to group related classes, interfaces, and sub-packages.

It helps in organizing code and avoiding name conflicts.

🔹 Sub-Package

A package inside another package is called a sub-package.

Declared using the . (dot) notation.

Example:

java.util is a sub-package of java

java.sql is also a sub-package of java

🔹 Example: Custom Package with Sub-Package
// File: mypack/MainClass.java
package mypack;

public class MainClass {
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Hello from MainClass in mypack package!");
    }
}

// File: mypack/subpack/SubClass.java
package mypack.subpack;   // sub-package inside mypack

public class SubClass {
    public void show() {
        System.out.println("Hello from SubClass in mypack.subpack package!");
    }
}

// File: Test.java
import mypack.MainClass;
import mypack.subpack.SubClass;

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MainClass m = new MainClass();
        m.display();

        SubClass s = new SubClass();
        s.show();
    }
}

🔹 Output
Hello from MainClass in mypack package!
Hello from SubClass in mypack.subpack package!

🔹 Interview Explanation

Yes, we can have a package inside another package (sub-package).

It allows better modularization and layered project structure.

Real-time example:

java.util → has sub-packages like java.util.concurrent, java.util.regex.

In Spring Framework, you’ll see org.springframework.boot, org.springframework.data.jpa, etc. (all sub-packages for modular design).


3. Key Points to Remember (Crucial for Interview)
No Special Access Privileges: A crucial point is that being a subpackage does not grant any special access. The protected and default (package-private) access modifiers are only valid within the exact same package.

A class in com.jarus.drones cannot access a class with default (no modifier) visibility in com.jarus.drones.navigation. They are considered different packages for access control.

Directory Structure Must Match: The physical folder structure on your computer must exactly mirror the package structure.

The class com.jarus.drones.navigation.GPS must be located in the folder com/jarus/drones/navigation/GPS.java.

Imports are Explicit: To use a class from a subpackage, you must import it using its fully qualified name (import com.jarus.drones.navigation.GPS;). You cannot use a wildcard to import all subpackages. import com.jarus.drones.*; will import classes only from the drones package, not from its subpackages like navigation or logistics.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

12. How will you declare a Package in Java?

A package in Java is used to group related classes, interfaces, and sub-packages together.
It helps in:

Avoiding name conflicts

Organizing code properly

Providing access protection

Syntax for Declaring a Package
package packageName;


👉 The package statement must be the first statement in your Java file (before imports and class definitions).

Steps to Declare and Use a Package
Step 1: Create a Package

Let’s say we want to create a package called myPackage.

// File: MyClass.java
package myPackage;   // Declaring the package

public class MyClass {
    public void displayMessage() {
        System.out.println("Hello from MyClass inside myPackage!");
    }
}


Now compile it with:

javac -d . MyClass.java


-d . tells Java to place compiled classes in the correct package folder (it creates a myPackage directory automatically).

Step 2: Use the Package

Now create another file TestPackage.java in the default folder:

// File: TestPackage.java
import myPackage.MyClass;   // Import the class from myPackage

public class TestPackage {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
        obj.displayMessage();
    }
}


Compile and run:

javac TestPackage.java
java TestPackage


✅ Output:

Hello from MyClass inside myPackage!

Types of Packages in Java

Built-in Packages → Already available in Java (e.g., java.util, java.io, java.sql).

User-defined Packages → Created by programmers (like the example above).

📌 In simple words:
Declaring a package = package packageName; at the top of your file.
It groups related classes together, just like putting books into the right bookshelf.
