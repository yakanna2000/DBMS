🌱 What is Spring Boot?

Spring Boot is a framework built on top of Spring Framework.

It makes it easier and faster to create standalone, production-ready applications in Java.

With Spring Boot, you don’t need to write a lot of configuration code. It provides sensible defaults and automatically configures most things.

⚡ Why use Spring Boot?

Faster Development – You can create a working app quickly without spending hours on setup.

Less Configuration – No need to manually configure everything (like database connections, web servers, etc.).

Embedded Server – Comes with Tomcat/Jetty inside, so you don’t need to deploy WAR files separately. Just run the app like a normal Java program.

Production-Ready – Has built-in tools like health checks, monitoring, and metrics.

Integration with JPA, Security, REST, etc. – Very easy to integrate with databases, build REST APIs, secure your app, etc.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🔹 1. What is IoC (Inversion of Control)?

Normally in Java, you create objects manually using new.

In Spring, IoC inverts this control → instead of you creating objects, the Spring Container creates and manages them.

This makes your code loose-coupled (classes depend less on each other).

👉 Example (Without IoC):

class Car {
    Engine engine = new Engine();  // Manually creating dependency
}


👉 Example (With IoC):

class Car {
    Engine engine;   // No "new" here, Spring will inject it
}


So, IoC means giving control of object creation & lifecycle to Spring.

🔹 2. What is DI (Dependency Injection)?

Dependency Injection (DI) is a way to implement IoC.

It means injecting required objects (dependencies) into a class instead of creating them inside the class.

Spring provides this automatically using annotations.


🔹 3. Types of Dependency Injection

Constructor Injection – Dependencies are provided through the constructor.

Setter Injection – Dependencies are provided through setter methods.

Field Injection – Dependencies are injected directly into fields (not recommended for large apps, but common in demos).


🔹 1. Constructor Injection

👉 Dependencies are passed into the class through its constructor.
✅ Best practice in Spring (because it makes classes immutable and easy to test).

Engine.java
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class Engine {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Engine started...");
    }
}

Car.java (Constructor Injection)
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class Car {
    private final Engine engine;

    // Constructor Injection
    @Autowired
    public Car(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }

    public void drive() {
        engine.start();
        System.out.println("Car is moving...");
    }
}

🔹 2. Setter Injection

👉 Dependencies are passed through setter methods.
✅ Useful if dependencies are optional or changeable after object creation.

Car.java (Setter Injection)
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    // Setter Injection
    @Autowired
    public void setEngine(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }

    public void drive() {
        engine.start();
        System.out.println("Car is moving...");
    }
}

🔹 3. Field Injection

👉 Dependencies are injected directly into fields using @Autowired.
❌ Not recommended for large apps (because it makes testing and immutability harder),
✅ but very common in small apps or demos.

Car.java (Field Injection)
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class Car {

    @Autowired
    private Engine engine;   // Field Injection

    public void drive() {
        engine.start();
        System.out.println("Car is moving...");
    }
}


🔹 5. What happens here?

@Component → Marks a class as a Spring-managed bean.

@Autowired → Tells Spring to inject the dependency automatically.

When you run the app:

Spring Boot creates an IoC container (ApplicationContext).

It creates objects of Engine and Car.

It injects Engine into Car (DI).

Finally, it calls car.drive() → output:

Engine started...
Car is moving...


✅ Summary:

IoC → Spring takes control of object creation & lifecycle.

DI → Spring injects required objects into your class.

🌱 Spring Framework

Core Java framework (released in 2003).

Provides features like IoC (Inversion of Control), DI (Dependency Injection), AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming), etc.

It is powerful but requires a lot of configuration (XML or annotations).

By itself, it doesn’t include an embedded server — you need to deploy apps on external servers like Tomcat, JBoss, WebLogic.

👉 Example (Spring Framework without Boot):
You want to connect to a database → you must manually configure DataSource, EntityManagerFactory, TransactionManager in XML or Java config.

🚀 Spring Boot

Built on top of Spring Framework (introduced in 2014).

Provides auto-configuration + embedded servers + production-ready tools.

Removes boilerplate configuration by using convention over configuration.

Comes with Spring Initializr (a website to quickly generate projects).

👉 Example (Spring Boot):
You just add spring-boot-starter-data-jpa in dependencies, and Boot automatically configures DataSource, EntityManagerFactory, TransactionManager for you.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Nice 👍 You’ve now reached two important annotations in Spring Boot DI:
@Primary and @Qualifier.
Both help Spring resolve conflicts when multiple beans of the same type exist.

🔹 Problem Scenario

Imagine you have two Engine classes:

import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class PetrolEngine {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Petrol engine started...");
    }
}

import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class DieselEngine {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Diesel engine started...");
    }
}


And in Car:

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class Car {
    @Autowired
    private PetrolEngine engine; // ❌ Problem: Which one to inject?
}


Spring will get confused because there are two beans (PetrolEngine, DieselEngine) of the same type.

🔹 1. @Primary

👉 Marks one bean as the default choice if multiple beans of the same type exist.

Example
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Primary;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
@Primary   // Default bean
public class PetrolEngine {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Petrol engine started...");
    }
}

@Component
public class DieselEngine {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Diesel engine started...");
    }
}


Now in Car:

@Component
public class Car {
    private final Engine engine;

    @Autowired
    public Car(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }

    public void drive() {
        engine.start();
        System.out.println("Car is moving...");
    }
}


👉 Output:

Petrol engine started...
Car is moving...


✅ @Primary → PetrolEngine is injected by default.

🔹 2. @Qualifier

👉 If you want to explicitly choose which bean to inject, use @Qualifier("beanName").

Example
@Component("petrolEngine")
public class PetrolEngine implements Engine {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Petrol engine started...");
    }
}

@Component("dieselEngine")
public class DieselEngine implements Engine {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Diesel engine started...");
    }
}


Now in Car:

@Component
public class Car {
    private final Engine engine;

    @Autowired
    public Car(@Qualifier("dieselEngine") Engine engine) { // Explicitly choosing DieselEngine
        this.engine = engine;
    }

    public void drive() {
        engine.start();
        System.out.println("Car is moving...");
    }
}


👉 Output:

Diesel engine started...
Car is moving...


✅ @Qualifier → Used to choose a specific bean when multiple candidates exist.

🔹 Interview Summary

@Primary → Default bean when multiple beans of same type exist.

@Qualifier → Explicitly specify which bean to use.

You can combine both:

@Primary sets the default.

@Qualifier overrides it if needed.

🌱 Spring (Without Boot)

Refers to the core Spring Framework.

Provides features like:

IoC (Inversion of Control)

Dependency Injection (DI)

AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming)

Spring MVC (Model-View-Controller)

Spring JDBC, Spring Data, Spring Security, etc.

But without Boot, you must do all configurations manually.


🔹 Characteristics of Spring (without Boot)

Manual Configuration

Define beans in applicationContext.xml or Java config class.

Example:

<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="
           http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
           http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

    <bean id="engine" class="com.example.Engine"/>
    <bean id="car" class="com.example.Car">
        <property name="engine" ref="engine"/>
    </bean>
</beans>


External Server Needed

Apps are packaged as WAR and deployed on Tomcat/Jetty/JBoss manually.

No Auto Configuration

If you want database + JPA + transactions → you configure everything manually.

More Boilerplate Code

Setting up a project requires lots of setup files (web.xml, dispatcher-servlet.xml, etc.).



🚀 Spring Boot (Difference)

If we used Spring Boot instead:

No XML config (just annotations like @Component, @Autowired).

No external Tomcat needed (embedded).

Auto-configuration (DB, JPA, REST, etc.).

Just run java -jar app.jar → app runs instantly.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


AOP

Great question 👍 Let’s go step by step into Spring AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming).

🔹 What is AOP?

AOP = Aspect Oriented Programming

It helps you separate cross-cutting concerns (code that is common across multiple modules).

👉 Example of cross-cutting concerns:

Logging

Security (authentication/authorization)

Transaction management

Performance monitoring

Instead of repeating these in every class, you define them once in an Aspect, and Spring applies them automatically.

🔹 Core Concepts in Spring AOP

Aspect

A class that contains cross-cutting logic (e.g., logging, security).

Advice

The actual action taken (e.g., log before method execution).

Types of Advice:

@Before → run before method

@After → run after method

@AfterReturning → run after method successfully returns

@AfterThrowing → run after exception

@Around → run before and after method

Join Point

A point in the program where advice can be applied (e.g., method execution).

Pointcut

A condition that selects which methods should be intercepted.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

spring xml configuratuon


Good question 👍 Let’s go into Spring XML Configuration in a clear and simple way.

🔹 What is XML Configuration in Spring?

Before annotations (@Component, @Autowired) and Java config (@Configuration), Spring beans were configured using XML files.

You define beans inside applicationContext.xml.

Then Spring IoC Container reads this XML and creates objects (beans).

This was the old style (still useful to understand for interviews).

🔹 Example 1: Basic Bean Configuration
1. Create a simple class
public class Engine {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("🚗 Engine started...");
    }
}

public class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    // Setter Injection
    public void setEngine(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }

    public void drive() {
        engine.start();
        System.out.println("🚙 Car is driving...");
    }
}

2. Define beans in applicationContext.xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
       http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

    <!-- Engine Bean -->
    <bean id="engine" class="com.example.Engine" />

    <!-- Car Bean with dependency injection -->
    <bean id="car" class="com.example.Car">
        <property name="engine" ref="engine"/>
    </bean>
</beans>

3. Load XML in Main Class
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext;

public class MainApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ApplicationContext context =
                new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("applicationContext.xml");

        Car car = (Car) context.getBean("car");
        car.drive();
    }
}

🔹 Output
🚗 Engine started...
🚙 Car is driving...

🔹 Key Points

<bean> tag → defines a bean.

id → bean name (used in getBean()).

class → fully qualified class name.

<property> → injects dependencies (Setter Injection).

ref → refers to another bean.



🔹 1. Setter Injection

Dependency is injected through a setter method.

Flexible → you can change dependencies later.

Needs a no-args constructor.

Example
Engine.java
public class Engine {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("🚗 Engine started...");
    }
}

Car.java
public class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    // Setter method
    public void setEngine(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }

    public void drive() {
        engine.start();
        System.out.println("🚙 Car is driving...");
    }
}

applicationContext.xml
<bean id="engine" class="com.example.Engine" />

<bean id="car" class="com.example.Car">
    <property name="engine" ref="engine"/>
</bean>


✅ Here Spring will call setEngine() and inject the Engine bean.

🔹 2. Constructor Injection

Dependency is injected through the constructor.

Makes dependencies mandatory.

Better for immutability (dependencies can’t be changed after creation).

Example
Car.java
public class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    // Constructor
    public Car(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }

    public void drive() {
        engine.start();
        System.out.println("🚙 Car is driving...");
    }
}

applicationContext.xml
<bean id="engine" class="com.example.Engine" />

<bean id="car" class="com.example.Car">
    <constructor-arg ref="engine"/>
</bean>


✅ Here Spring will call the constructor Car(Engine engine) to inject the dependency.
